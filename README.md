# Constant Model

**ConstantModel** provides a simple framework for modeling complex
*Statically Defined Objects*. These are objects that might otherwise
be modeled using persistence technologies such as Django models, but
that do not belong in the database.

To wet your appetite, look at this [Sample Code](https://github.com/wsmith323/constantmodel/blob/master/tests/sample.py).

For more details, read the [Documentation](https://constantmodel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
