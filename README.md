# Static Model

**StaticModel** provides a simple framework for modeling objects that
might otherwise be modeled using persistence technologies such as
the Django ORM, but that do not belong in the database.

To wet your appetite, look at this [Sample Code](https://github.com/wsmith323/staticmodel/blob/master/tests/sample.py).

For more details, read the [Documentation](https://staticmodel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
